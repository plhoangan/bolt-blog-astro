Astro is a modern static site builder that offers an innovative approach to web development. In this guide, we'll explore the basics of getting started with Astro and why it might be the perfect choice for your next project.

## Why Choose Astro?

Astro stands out from other frameworks due to its "partial hydration" approach. This means you can build interactive components using your favorite framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) while shipping zero JavaScript by default.

## Key Features

- **Zero JavaScript Runtime**: Astro websites ship with zero JavaScript by default
- **Component Islands**: Add interactivity only where needed
- **Multiple Framework Support**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or plain JavaScript
- **Built-in Markdown Support**: Perfect for content-heavy websites
- **Top-tier Performance**: Optimized builds out of the box

## Getting Started

To create your first Astro project, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

This will guide you through the setup process and create a new Astro project with all the necessary files and configurations.
